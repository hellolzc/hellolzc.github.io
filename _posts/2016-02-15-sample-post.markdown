## A Sample

You'll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}

## About the theme

#### What's this

[Vno Jekyll](https://github.com/onevcat/vno-jekyll) is a theme for [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com). It is a port of my Ghost theme [vno](https://github.com/onevcat/vno), which is originally developed from [Dale Anthony's Uno](https://github.com/daleanthony/uno).

#### Usage

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/onevcat/vno-jekyll.git your_site
$ cd your_site
$ bundler install
$ bundler exec jekyll serve
```

Your site with `Vno Jekyll` enabled should be accessible in http://127.0.0.1:4000.

For more information about Jekyll, please visit [Jekyll's site](http://jekyllrb.com).

#### Configuration

All configuration could be done in `_config.yml`. Remember you need to restart to serve the page when after changing the config file. Everything in the config file should be self-explanatory.

#### Background image and avatar

You could replace the background and avatar image in `assets/images` folder to change them.

#### Sites using Vno

[My blog](http://onevcat.com) is using `Vno Jekyll` as well, you could see how it works in real. There are some other sites using the same theme. You can find them below:
